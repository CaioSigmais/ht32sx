The HT32SX is a System-in-Package (SiP) device build for the Internet of Things providing a **ready-to-use** connectivity solution.
It means that you’ll have strong reduction in your BOM cost, aiming a fast integration, simple design and the lowest **time-to-market**. It provides both uplink (transmit) and downlink (receive) network communications. As a SigFox™ Monarch enabled device, it allows globetrotter devices to seamlessly roam across the planet taking advantage of the global SigFox™ network coverage without need of reconfiguration, this setup is done automatically.
